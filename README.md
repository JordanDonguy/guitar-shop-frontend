# 🎸 Guitar Shop Frontend

A responsive, modern frontend for an online guitar store. This application is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and connects to a backend API for product data, authentication, cart management, and checkout.

> ⚠️ This app is meant to be used via its live deployment. Local development is limited due to backend API restrictions (e.g., CORS policies, origin whitelist).
